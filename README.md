### What is this repository for? ###

These files are related to the organization of a seminar on applied and interdisciplinary
mathematics; the aim is to explore a wide range of new developments in fields related to
applied mathematics to foster new research ideas. The seminar will be informal; anyone is
welcome to suggest a topic, which might be: the details of an interesting proof, a review
of a paper, or the implementation of a new algorithm.

For the moment, the main file in this repository will be a BibTeX repository of papers to
consider for future topics, but in the future, short summaries or explorations may be added
and used as source material for online posts.
